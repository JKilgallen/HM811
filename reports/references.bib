	abstract = {The motion aftereffect is a robust illusion of visual motion resulting from exposure to a moving pattern. There is a widely accepted explanation of it in terms of changes in the response of cortical direction-selective neurons. Research has distinguished several variants of the effect. Converging recent evidence from different
experimental techniques (psychophysics, single-unit recording, brain imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, visual evoked potentials and magnetoencephalography) reveals that adaptation is not confined to one or even two cortical areas, but occurs at multiple levels of processing involved in visual motion analysis. A tentative motion-processing framework is described, based
on motion aftereffect research. Recent ideas on the function of adaptation see it as a form of gain control that maximises the efficiency of information transmission at multiple levels of the visual pathway.},

	abstract = {Prolonged observation of a stationary grating has a number of perceptual consequences. Initially the lines appear well-resolved and straight. The lines then take on a wavy and oscillating appearance, which is followed by scintillation of the pattern. The scintillations are often accompanied by cloudy disappearances of the grating. A streaming or scintillating aftereffect is visible subsequently, upon viewing a homogeneous surface. The literature concerning these effects is reviewed and several experiments are reported which examined the apparent waviness and scintillating disappearances. The basis for the apparent waviness remains unresolved. It is suggested that the scintillations are produced by small involuntary eye movements over the contours and that the associated disappearances might be due to binocular rivalry.},

	abstract = {Some well-known visual illusions have been examined under conditions which remove the effect of eye movements so that the image on the retina is stationary. Under these conditions the simple geometrical illusions are perceived in the normal way. Ambiguous perceptive figures show the reversals at about the usual rate provided that the subject is able to direct his attention to a salient point of the pattern. Certain regular stationary patterns produce illusory shadows which appear to move across the pattern in normal vision. These shadows are not seen when the effect of eye movements is removed.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous pattern formation in cortical activity may have consequences for perception, but little is known about interactions between sensory-driven and self-organized cortical activity. To address this deficit, we explored the relationship between ordinary stimulus-controlled pattern perception and the autonomous hallucinatory geometrical pattern formation that occurs for unstructured visual stimulation (e.g., empty-field flicker). We found that flicker-induced hallucinations are biased by the presentation of adjacent geometrical stimuli; geometrical forms that map to cortical area V1 as orthogonal gratings are perceptually opponent in biasing hallucinations. Rotating fan blades and pulsating circular patterns are the most salient biased hallucinations. Apparent motion and fractal (1/
              f
              ) noise are also effective in driving hallucinatory pattern formation (the latter is consistent with predictions of spatiotemporal pattern formation driven by stochastic resonance). The behavior of these percepts suggests that self-organized hallucinatory pattern formation in human vision is governed by the same cortical properties of localized processing, lateral inhibition, simultaneous contrast, and nonlinear retinotopic mapping that govern ordinary vision.},
